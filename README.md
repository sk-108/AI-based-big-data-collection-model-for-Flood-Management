Design AI based big data collection model for Flood Management. This project aims to create a model which is based on AI, can use big data to provide dataset for input and can predict the outcome using some AI algorithm for the management of flood. This model can predict whether there will be floods or not. Model can help people to prepare themselves for the worst scenario. A reliable flood management model has almost a maximum or near 90 â€“ 100 % probability of getting the right outcome. The number of flood events has significantly increased all around the world over past years, but the number of casualties has decreased as there are more and more management models for the evacuation and warning for floods. Therefore, there is a great need for the existing models to be updated regularly according to the new challenges and our project aims to that sight only
